F.L.O.E stands for:
* Facial recognition
* facial Fandmark detection
* Object recognition
* Emotion detection. 

These are the four machine vision processes this program can do. It can detect one or more faces and can tell whether it is a stranger or whether the program knows the person from its face images database. It can detect sad, happy, angry, disgust, and suprise, it can detect facial landmakrs such as nose, right eyebrow, left eye, etc., and can detect up to twenty objects all from a webcam feed. The user can press certain keys, 'f' for facial recognition, 'l' for facial landmark detection, 'o' for object detection, or 'e' for emotion detection, to do the negation of whatever the state is; on or off. They can also press 'A' to turn all on or off and 'q' or 'ESC' to end the process all together.
