F.L.E.O stands for Facial recognition, facial Landmark detection, and Object recognition, Emotion detection. These are the four machine vision processes this program can do. It can detect one or more faces and can tell whether it is a stranger or whether the program knows the person from its face images database. It can detect sad, happy, angry, disgust, and suprise, can detect facial landmakrs such as nose, right eyebrow, left eye, etc., and can detect up to twenty objects all from a webcam feed. The user can choose if they want one, two, three, or all of them running by pressing 'f' for facial recognition, 'l' for facial landmark detection, 'o' for object detection, or 'e' for emotion detection. They can also press 'q' or 'ESC' to end the process.
