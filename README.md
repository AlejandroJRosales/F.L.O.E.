F.L.O.E stands for:
* **F**acial recognition
* facial **L**andmark recognition
* **O**bject recognition
* **E**motion recogntion. 

These are the four machine vision processes this program can do. It can detect one or more faces and can tell whether it is a stranger or whether the program knows the person from its face images database. It can detect sad, happy, angry, disgust, and surprise, it can detect facial landmarks such as the nose, right eyebrow, left eye, etc., and can detect up to twenty objects all from a webcam feed. The user can press keys, 'f' for facial recognition, 'l' for facial landmark recognition, 'o' for object recognition, or 'e' for emotion recognition, to do the negation of whatever the state is; on or off. They can also press 'A' to turn all on or off and 'q' or 'ESC' to end the process all together. Lastly
it also displays CPU usage in the video frame.
